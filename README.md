## Part 1: Prepare the data for use on a neural network model ##
Using your knowledge of Pandas and scikit-learn’s StandardScaler(), preprocess the dataset so that you can use it to compile and evaluate the neural network model later.

Open the starter code file and complete the following data preparation steps:

1. Read the data from https://static.bc-edx.com/ai/ail-v-1-0/m18/lms/datasets/student-loans.csvLinks to an external site. into a Pandas DataFrame. Review the DataFrame, looking for columns that could eventually define your features and target variables.

2. Create the features (X) and target (y) datasets. The target dataset should be defined by the “credit_ranking” column. The remaining columns should define the features dataset.

3. Split the features and target sets into training and testing datasets.

4. Use scikit-learn's StandardScaler to scale the features data.

## Part 2: Compile and Evaluate a Model Using a Neural Network ##
Use your knowledge of TensorFlow to design a deep neural network model. This model should use the dataset’s features to predict the credit quality of a student based on the features in the dataset. Consider the number of inputs before determining the number of layers that your model will contain or the number of neurons on each layer. Then, compile and fit your model. Finally, evaluate the model to calculate its loss and accuracy.

To do so, complete the following steps:

1. Create a deep neural network by assigning the number of input features, the number of layers, and the number of neurons on each layer using TensorFlow’s Keras.

2. Compile and fit the model using the binary_crossentropy loss function, the adam optimizer, and the accuracy evaluation metric.

3. Evaluate the model using the test data to determine the model’s loss and accuracy.

4. Save and export your model to a keras file, and name the file student_loans.keras.

## Part 3: Predict loan repayment success by using your neural network model ##
Use the model you saved in the previous section to make predictions on your reserved testing data.

To do so, complete the following steps:

1. Reload your saved model.

2. Make predictions on the testing data, saving them to a DataFrame and rounding the predictions to binary values.

3. Generate a classification report with the predictions and testing data.

## Part 4: Discuss creating a recommendation system for student loans ##
Briefly answer the following questions in the space provided:

1. Describe the data that you would need to collect to build a recommendation system to recommend student loan options for students. Explain why this data would be relevant and appropriate.

2. Based on the data you chose to use in this recommendation system, would your model be using collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or context-based filtering? Justify why the data you selected would be suitable for your choice of filtering method.

3. Describe two real-world challenges that you would take into consideration while building a recommendation system for student loans. Explain why these challenges would be of concern for a student loan recommendation system.

**1. Describe the data that you would need to collect to build a recommendation system to recommend student loan options for students. Explain why this data would be relevant and appropriate.**

To build a recommendation system for student loan options:
  1. Demographic Information: Age, gender, income level, location, and educational background. This data helps in understanding the student's profile and financial capabilities.
  2. Loan Options: Details of available loans, including interest rates, repayment terms, eligibility criteria, and lender ratings. This information is essential to compare and recommend suitable loan options.
  3. Student Preferences: Information about students’ preferences for loan characteristics, such as the maximum interest rate they are willing to accept or preferred repayment terms. This data ensures that the recommendations align with individual student needs.
  4. Credit History: Students’ credit scores or credit history can affect eligibility and terms of loans, making it important for personalized recommendations.
  5. Past Experiences and Reviews: Data from previous borrowers about their experiences with various lenders can enhance recommendations by highlighting trustworthy options.


**2. Based on the data you chose to use in this recommendation system, would your model be using collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or context-based filtering? Justify why the data you selected would be suitable for your choice of filtering method.**

The model would likely use content-based filtering. This method recommends options based on the specific attributes of the loans and the student's profile, such as demographics, preferences, and credit history.

Justification:

  1.  Content-based filtering relies on understanding the characteristics of items (in this case, loan options) and matching them with user preferences. The demographic and preference data collected would enable the model to suggest loans that align closely with the student’s financial profile and requirements.
  2. Unlike collaborative filtering, which depends on the behavior of other users, content-based filtering provides personalized recommendations without needing user interaction data from others, making it suitable for this scenario where each student's situation is unique.

**  3. Describe two real-world challenges that you would take into consideration while building a recommendation system for student loans. Explain why these challenges would be of concern for a student loan recommendation system. **

#Data Privacy and Security:#

  1. Concern: Collecting and processing sensitive personal data, such as income, credit scores, and demographics, raises privacy and security issues. Protecting this data from breaches is critical, as misuse could lead to identity theft or financial fraud.

  2. Impact: Ensuring data privacy is crucial for gaining students’ trust and compliance with regulations (like GDPR or FERPA). Failure to protect this data could undermine the effectiveness and adoption of the recommendation system.
